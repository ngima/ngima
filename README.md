<h1>Hi, I'm Ngima</h1>
<h2>Lead Frontend Developer</h2>

I design and build mobile apps with care. With 9+ years of experience in native and cross-platform development and UI design, I focus on clean architecture and human-centered solutions - currently contributing to women's health at Endo Health GmbH.

I'm also into AI, blockchain, photography, digital art, crossfit, and music.
